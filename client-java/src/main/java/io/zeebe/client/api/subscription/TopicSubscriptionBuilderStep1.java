   * subscription with the same name is (re-)opened then the broker resumes the subscription at the
   * last acknowledged position and starts publishing with the next event/command.
   *
   * <p>The initial position of the subscription can be defined by calling <code>
   * startAtHeadOfTopic()</code>, <code>startAtTailOfTopic()</code> or <code>startAtPosition()
   * </code>. If the subscription has already an acknowledged position then these calls are ignored
   * and the subscription resumes at the acknowledged position. Use <code>forcedStart()</code> to

   *
   * <pre>
   * TopicSubscription subscription = topicClient
   *  .newSubscription()
   *  .name("my-app")

   *  .startAtPosition(0)
