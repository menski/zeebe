   * Set the (unique) name of the subscription.

   * subscription with the same name is (re-)opened then the broker resumes the subscription at the
   * last acknowledged position and starts publishing with the next event/command.
   *
   * <p>The initial position of the subscription can be defined by calling <code>
   * startAtHeadOfTopic()</code>, <code>startAtTailOfTopic()</code> or <code>startAtPosition()
   * </code>. If the subscription has already an acknowledged position then these calls are ignored
   * and the subscription resumes at the acknowledged position. Use <code>forcedStart()</code> to
   * enforce starting at the supplied start position.

   *
   * <pre>
   * TopicSubscription subscription = zeebeClient
   *  .newManagementSubscription()
   *  .name("my-app")
   *  .deploymentEventHandler(deploymentEventHandler)
   *  .startAtHeadOfTopic()
   *  .open();
